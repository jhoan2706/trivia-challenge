# Trivia Challenge App

Welcome to the Trivia Challenge App! This app is a simple quiz application built with Vue.js and Laravel.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Laravel: You need a Laravel environment to serve the Vue.js app.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd trivia-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

1. Start the Laravel development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   Ensure the Laravel server is running on `http://localhost:8000`.

2. In a separate terminal, start the Vue.js development server:

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```

   The Vue.js app will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the Trivia Challenge App.
```

This revised version provides clear instructions for cloning the repository, navigating to the project directory, and installing the necessary dependencies. It also separates the "Running the App" section into distinct steps for starting the Laravel server and the Vue.js development server. Feel free to adjust any additional details as needed.
